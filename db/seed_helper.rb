      "<p><strong>Cache&nbsp;</strong>An area of RAM reserved for data recently read from disk, which allows the processor to quickly retrieve it if it&#39;s needed again.</p> <br><p><strong>Caching</strong>&nbsp;A process in which frequently accessed data is kept on hand, rather than constantly being from the place where it is stored.</p> <br><p><strong>Case-dependent</strong>&nbsp;Software differentiation between upper and lower case characters. Also referred to as case sensitive.</p> <br><p><strong>CCD</strong>&nbsp;Charge-coupled device. An integrated, micro-electrical light sensing device built into some image capturing devices.</p> <br><p><strong>CD-ROM</strong>&nbsp;Compact Disk, Read-Only Memory. A type of storage device that looks just like an audio CD and stores as much data as a large hard disk (600MB), making it a popular means of distributing fonts, photos, electronic encyclopedias, games, and multimedia offerings. As the name indicates, however, you can&#39;t save or change files on a CD-ROM, only read them. Pronounced&nbsp;<strong>see-dee rom</strong>.</p> <br><p><strong>CGI&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Common Gateway Interface. A method of running an executable script or program from a Web server. When a client requests a URL pointing to a CGI, the program is run and the results are returned to the client. This enables dynamic web pages and the ability to do database queries and other complex operations across the web</p> <br><p><strong>CIE</strong>&nbsp;The &quot;Commission Internationale de l&#39;Eclairage&quot;. An organization that has established a number of widely-used color definitions.</p> <br><p><strong>Circuit-switched</strong>&nbsp;A type of network connection which establishes a continuous electrical connection between calling and called users for their exclusive use until the connection is released. Ericsson PBX is a circuit-switched network.</p> <br><p><strong>Clickable Image</strong>&nbsp;Any image that has instructions embedded in it so that clicking on it initiates some kind of action or result. On a web page, a clickable image is any image that has a URL embedded in it.</p> <br><p><strong>Client/server relationship</strong>&nbsp;A client application is one that resides on a user&#39;s computer, but sends requests to a remote system to execute a designated procedure using arguments supplied by the user. The computer that initiates the request is the client and the computer responding to the request is the server. Many network services follow a client and server protocol.</p> <br><p><strong>Clipboard</strong>&nbsp;An area used to temporarily store cut or copied information. The Clipboard can store text, graphics, objects, and other data. The Clipboard contents are erased when new information is placed on the Clipboard or when the computer is shut down.</p> <br><p><strong>Clipping</strong>&nbsp;The conversion of all tones lighter than a specified grey level to white, or darker than a specified grey level to black, causing loss of detail. This also applies to individual channels in a color image.</p> <br><p><strong>CMS</strong>&nbsp;Color management system. This ensures color uniformity across input and output devices so that final printed results match originals.
